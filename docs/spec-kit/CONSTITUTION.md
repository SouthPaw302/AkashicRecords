### Project Constitution (Spec Kit)

Principles
- Specification first: problems and acceptance criteria precede code
- Small PRs, linked to issues, reviewed before merge
- Security by default: no secrets in code, client keys treated as public
- Documentation as part of delivery
- Tests or clear manual verification notes

Workflow
1. Specify
2. Plan
3. Tasks
4. Implement
5. Review & merge
